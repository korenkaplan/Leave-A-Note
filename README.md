# Leave A Note: Transforming Parking Incident Solutions

Welcome to Leave A Note ‚Äì your go-to platform for seamless parking incident resolutions. With our secure and efficient system, users can effortlessly leave notes and reports  in situations where direct communication isn't feasible.

## How It Works

Whether you're directly involved in the incident or acting as a supportive witness, our process is simple and user-friendly:

1. **Enter Car Number**: Begin by typing in the car number involved in the incident. 

2. **Capture Photo**: Take a quick photo of the accident scene. 

3. **Send Report**: Hit that "Send" button! Your report will be securely submitted through our system.

**That's it!** The magic of Leave A Note does the rest. If the other driver is also a user of our app, they'll promptly receive your message and can communicate with you. In the event that the driver isn't registered on the app yet, no worries ‚Äì we've got you covered. Your report will be safely stored, ready to be delivered whenever they join our community.

At Leave A Note, our aim is to simplify the process, reduce stress, and foster community support among drivers. If you've got any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. Let's make parking incidents pyhisical notes a thing of the past and create a more cooperative and hassle-free experience together! üöóüìùü§ù


This repository exclusively hosts the client-side of our application. In addition, the application is further developed across two primary branches:
- `main` branch:This branch is for [this server project](https://github.com/korenkaplan/Leave-A-Note-NodeJS-Server), a Node js, mongoDB backend.
- `NET_Core_Backend` Branch : This branch is for [this server project](https://github.com/korenkaplan/LeaveANoteServerProject) an ASP.NET Core backend, SQL database .

## About The Idea

**The Problem:**
Parking incidents can be frustrating and stressful, especially when the other driver involved is not present to exchange details. This often leads to a lack of information and difficulties in resolving insurance claims. "Leave A Note" aims to bridge this communication gap and provide a reliable means for drivers and witnesses to share vital information, ensuring a fair and hassle-free process in such situations.

**Target Audience:**
Our platform caters to all drivers, whether they have experienced a parking incident or want to assist others as witnesses. By bringing drivers together on a single platform, "Leave A Note" fosters a community-driven approach to resolve parking-related issues.

**Benefits and Advantages:**
- Streamlined Process: Leave A Note takes simplicity to the next level. With just the car number involved in the accident and a quick picture, users can effortlessly document the incident. No complex forms or time-consuming processes, making it easy for anyone to use and contribute valuable information.
- Reduced Stress: Leave A Note alleviates the stress associated with parking accidents, making it easier for drivers to handle such situations.
- Community Support: The platform fosters a supportive community of drivers and witnesses, encouraging cooperative assistance during parking incidents.

**Privacy and Security:**
- Privacy of a Reporter (3rd Party Witness): As a 3rd party witness, you have the option to remain completely anonymous when reporting an accident between two other drivers. Your identity will never be disclosed to the involved parties, ensuring you can contribute valuable information without any concerns about personal exposure.
- Asymmetric Information Sharing: To further protect your privacy, "Leave A Note" operates on asymmetric information sharing. Only the damaged user will have access to the details of the hitting driver, while the reverse is not permitted. This ensures that the user who experienced the incident retains full control over the exchange of information, maintaining their privacy and personal safety.

## Roadmap

- **Multi-Language Support:** Recognizing our diverse user base, we plan to introduce multi-language support. Users will be able to interact with the platform in their preferred language, promoting inclusivity and ease of use for everyone.

- **Geo-Tagging and Mapping Integration:** To better understand incident locations, we will integrate geo-tagging and mapping functionalities. This will help users visualize the incident locations and provide a more accurate context for reporting and resolving parking incidents.

- **Image Download and Note Share as PDF:** In response to user requests, we will be introducing the ability to download incident images and notes as PDF files. This feature ensures users can keep a secure offline copy for their records or easily share the incident details with relevant parties.

- **User Feedback System for Problem and Bug Reports:** Your feedback matters to us! To provide a more streamlined way for users to report problems and bugs, we will introduce a user feedback system. This feature will allow you to submit any issues you encounter directly through the platform, enabling us to address and resolve them promptly.
